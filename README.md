# LSL.dev

LSL.dev is brand new home for LSL â€” focused on being a modernised version of the [LSL Portal of the SL Wiki](https://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/LSL_Portal).

This project is unofficial, and currently being developed and maintained by myself Martin Pitt, whom you may be more familiar with as Nexii Malthus in-world.

As a work in progress, I'm working on setting up the project and giving it a steady starting place before slowly ramping up the involvement of contributors into the project to make a true community open-source project by LSL Scripters for LSL Scripters.

There is also a sister project at [Martin-Pitt/slua.dev](https://github.com/Martin-Pitt/slua.dev) which will cover the documentation of the new Second Life scripting language SLua that is currently available on the beta grid.

The high-level roadmap is roughly as follows:

1. Setup LSL.dev the project
1. Figure out approach, styling, theme, what I can and should do, user experience, info architecture, content design
1. Core content/templates
1. Migrate content from the current wiki
	* Starting with a few pages at first to test different types of content and their integration / necessary components to design and develop
	* May take opportunity to rewrite pages as I migrate them! Of course this is an insane amount of work â€” but look, I've been in and out of the LSL wiki for two decades now
1. Feature Category pages that are as useful as my [Combat2 article](https://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Category:LSL_Combat2)
	* I want really high quality overview pages that summarise/bullet point the most important aspects of that feature and are chock full of internal links throughout
	* This will be a LOT of work because a lot of the LSL feature pages are really bad, outdated, undocumented or just needing a bit of TLC
1. Put LSL.dev into a useful state first
	1. Where all the reference/lookup pages are covered first
	1. â€¦ following by ways of navigating to them through simple Feature Categories
	1. Fleshing out those Feature Category pages over time from a simple lookup index and into teaching material
1. Further development and the future of SL technical documentation and knowledge
	* Guides, Recipes, Tutorials, Discord community, â€¦
	* SLua.dev
	* *Maybe* an updated [Content Creator docs site](https://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Creation_Portal) that covers avatars, building, textures, 3D modelling, videos, region design, landscaping, content creation within community nichÃ©s like SLMC, Sailing, Aircraft/Airports, Driving/Drivers of SL
	* *Maybe* a general SL knowledge site? Cover avatars, exploration, activities, linden homes, communities like SLMC, Sailing, Aircraft/Airports, Driving/Drivers of SL, Bay City, â€¦

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro + Starlight project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ docs/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ content.config.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |

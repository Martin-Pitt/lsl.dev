Add an extra custom HTTP header to the request. The first string is the name of the parameter to change, e.g. &quot;Pragma&quot;, and the second string is the value, e.g. &quot;no-cache&quot;. Up to 8 custom headers may be configured per request. Note that certain headers, such as the default headers, are blocked for security reasons.

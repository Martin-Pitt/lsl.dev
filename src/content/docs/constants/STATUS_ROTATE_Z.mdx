<LSLConstant name="STATUS_ROTATE_Z"/>

Controls/indicates whether the object can physically rotate around

			the specific axis or not. This flag has no meaning

			for non-physical objects. Set the value to FALSE

			if you want to disable rotation around that axis. The

			default is TRUE for a physical object.

			A useful example to think about when visualizing

			the effect is a sit-and-spin device. They spin around the

			Z axis (up) but not around the X or Y axis.

<LSLConstant name="VEHICLE_ANGULAR_DEFLECTION_EFFICIENCY"/>

A slider between minimum (0.0) and maximum (1.0) deflection of angular orientation. That is, its a simple scalar for modulating the strength of angular deflection such that the vehicles preferred axis of motion points toward its real velocity.

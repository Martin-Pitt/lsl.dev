		Controls/indicates whether the object can physically rotate around
					the specific axis or not. This flag has no meaning
					for non-physical objects. Set the value to FALSE
					if you want to disable rotation around that axis. The
					default is TRUE for a physical object.
					A useful example to think about when visualizing
					the effect is a sit-and-spin device. They spin around the
					Z axis (up) but not around the X or Y axis.

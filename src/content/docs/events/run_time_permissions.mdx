Scripts need permission from either the owner or the avatar they wish to act on before they may perform certain functions, such as debiting money from their owners account, triggering an animation on an avatar, or capturing control inputs. The llRequestPermissions library function is used to request these permissions and the various permissions integer constants can be supplied.

			The integer returned to this event handler contains the current set of permissions flags, so if permissions equal 0 then no permissions are set.

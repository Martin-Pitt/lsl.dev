<LSLFunction name="llDeleteSubString"/>

Removes the indicated sub-string and returns the result.

Start and End are inclusive.

Using negative numbers for Start and/or End causes the index to count backwards from the length of the string, so 0, -1 would delete the entire string.

If Start is larger than End, the sub-string is the exclusion of the entries; so 6, 4 would delete the entire string except for the 5th. character.

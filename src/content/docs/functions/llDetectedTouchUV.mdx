Returns a vector that is the texture coordinates for where the prim was touched.

The X and Y vector positions contain the U and V face coordinates respectively.

TOUCH_INVALID_TEXCOORD is returned if the touch UV coordinates cannot be determined (e.g. when the viewer does not support this function).

Shows a dialog box on the avatar's screen with the message.



                    Up to 12 strings in the list form buttons.



                    If a button is clicked, the name is chatted on Channel.

Opens a &quot;notify box&quot; in the given avatars screen displaying the message.



                Up to twelve buttons can be specified in a list of strings. When the user clicks a button, the name of the button is said on the specified channel.



                Channels work just like llSay(), so channel 0 can be heard by everyone.



                The chat originates at the object's position, not the avatar's position, even though it is said as the avatar (uses avatar's UUID and Name etc.).



                Examples:



                llDialog(who, &quot;Are you a boy or a girl?&quot;, [ &quot;Boy&quot;, &quot;Girl&quot; ], -4913);



                llDialog(who, &quot;This shows only an OK button.&quot;, [], -192);



                llDialog(who, &quot;This chats so you can 'hear' it.&quot;, [&quot;Hooray&quot;], 0);

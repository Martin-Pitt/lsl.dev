Evade a specified target.

Characters will (roughly) try to hide from their pursuers if there is a good hiding spot along their fleeing path. Hiding means no direct line of sight from the head of the character (centre of the top of its physics bounding box) to the head of its pursuer and no direct path between the two on the navigation-mesh.

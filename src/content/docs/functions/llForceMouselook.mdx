<LSLFunction
	name="llForceMouselook"
	arguments={[
	{
		"name": "Enable",
		"type": "integer",
		"description": "Boolean, if TRUE when an avatar sits on the prim, the avatar will be forced into mouse-look mode.\nFALSE is the default setting and will undo a previously set TRUE or do nothing."
	}
]}
/>

If Enable is TRUE any avatar that sits on this object is forced into mouse-look mode.

After calling this function with Enable set to TRUE, any agent sitting down on the prim will be forced into mouse-look.

Just like llSitTarget, this changes a permanent property of the prim (not the object) and needs to be reset by calling this function with Enable set to FALSE in order to disable it.

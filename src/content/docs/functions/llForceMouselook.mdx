<LSLFunction name="llForceMouselook"/>

If Enable is TRUE any avatar that sits on this object is forced into mouse-look mode.

After calling this function with Enable set to TRUE, any agent sitting down on the prim will be forced into mouse-look.

Just like llSitTarget, this changes a permanent property of the prim (not the object) and needs to be reset by calling this function with Enable set to FALSE in order to disable it.

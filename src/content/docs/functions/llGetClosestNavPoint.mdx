<LSLFunction name="llGetClosestNavPoint"/>

Get the closest navigable point to the point provided.

The function accepts a point in region-local space (like all the other path-finding methods) and returns either an empty list or a list containing a single vector which is the closest point on the navigation-mesh to the point provided.

Returns a list of up to 100 residents who own objects on the parcel at Position, with per-owner land impact totals.

Requires owner-like permissions for the parcel, and for the script owner to be present in the region.

The list is formatted as [ key agentKey1, integer agentLI1, key agentKey2, integer agentLI2, ... ], sorted by agent key.

The integers are the combined land impacts of the objects owned by the corresponding agents.

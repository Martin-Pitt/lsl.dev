<LSLFunction name="llGiveInventoryList"/>

Give InventoryItems to destination (represented by TargetID) as a new folder of items, as permitted by the permissions system.

TargetID may be any agent or an object in the same region. If TargetID is an object, the items are passed directly to the object inventory (no folder is created).

Critically damps to height if within height * 0.5 of level (either above ground level or above the higher of land and water if water == TRUE).

Critically damps to fHeight if within fHeight * 0.5 of ground or water level.



                    The height is above ground level if iWater is FALSE or above the higher of land and water if iWater is TRUE.



                    Do not use with vehicles. Only works in physics-enabled objects.

<LSLFunction name="llLinkParticleSystem"/>

Creates a particle system in prim LinkNumber based on Rules. An empty list removes a particle system from object.

List format is [ rule-1, data-1, rule-2, data-2 ... rule-n, data-n ].

This is identical to llParticleSystem except that it applies to a specified linked prim and not just the prim the script is in.

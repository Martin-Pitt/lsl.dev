<LSLFunction name="llLinkPlaySound"/>

Plays Sound, once or looping, at Volume (0.0 - 1.0). The sound may be attached to the link or triggered at its location.

Only one sound may be attached to an object at a time, and attaching a new sound or calling llStopSound will stop the previously attached sound.

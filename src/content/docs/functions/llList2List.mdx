<LSLFunction name="llList2List"/>

Returns a subset of entries from ListVariable, in a range specified by the Start and End indicies (inclusive).

Using negative numbers for Start and/or End causes the index to count backwards from the length of the string, so 0, -1 would capture the entire string.

If Start is greater than End, the sub string is the exclusion of the entries.

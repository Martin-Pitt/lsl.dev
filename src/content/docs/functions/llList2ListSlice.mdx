Returns a subset of entries from ListVariable, in a range specified by Start and End indices (inclusive) return the slice_index element of each stride.

 Using negative numbers for Start and/or End causes the index to count backwards from the length of the list. (e.g. 0, -1 captures entire list)

If slice_index is less than 0, it is counted backwards from the end of the stride.

 Stride must be a positive integer &gt; 0 or an empy list is returned.  If slice_index falls outside range of stride, an empty list is returned. slice_index is zero-based. (e.g. A stride of 2 has valid indices 0,1)

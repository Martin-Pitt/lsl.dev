Non-empty values for SpeakersName, SpeakersID, and Text will filter the results accordingly, while empty strings and NULL_KEY will not filter the results, for string and key parameters respectively.

PUBLIC_CHANNEL is the public chat channel that all avatars see as chat text. DEBUG_CHANNEL is the script debug channel, and is also visible to nearby avatars. All other channels are are not sent to avatars, but may be used to communicate with scripts.

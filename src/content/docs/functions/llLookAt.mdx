Cause object name to point its forward axis towards Target, at a force controlled by Strength and Damping.

Good Strength values are around half the mass of the object and good Damping values are less than 1/10th of the Strength.

Asymmetrical shapes require smaller Damping. A Strength of 0.0 cancels the look at.

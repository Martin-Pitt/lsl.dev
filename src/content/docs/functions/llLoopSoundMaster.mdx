		Plays attached Sound, looping at volume (0.0 - 1.0), and declares it a sync master.
		
		Behaviour is identical to llLoopSound, with the addition of marking the source as a &quot;Sync Master&quot;, causing &quot;Slave&quot; sounds to sync to it. If there are multiple masters within a viewers interest area, the most audible one (a function of both distance and volume) will win out as the master.
		
		The use of multiple masters within a small area is unlikely to produce the desired effect.

Plays attached sound looping at volume (0.0 - 1.0), synced to most audible sync master.

Behaviour is identical to llLoopSound, unless there is a &quot;Sync Master&quot; present.

If a Sync Master is already playing the Slave sound will begin playing from the same point the master is in its loop synchronizing the loop points of both sounds.

If a Sync Master is started when the Slave is already playing, the Slave will skip to the correct position to sync with the Master.

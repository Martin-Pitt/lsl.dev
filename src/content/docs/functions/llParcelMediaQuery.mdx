Queries the media properties of the parcel containing the script, via one or more PARCEL_MEDIA_COMMAND_* arguments specified in CommandList.

This function will only work if the script is contained within an object owned by the land-owner (or if the land is owned by a group, only if the object has been deeded to the group).

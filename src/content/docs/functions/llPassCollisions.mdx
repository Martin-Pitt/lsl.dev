<LSLFunction name="llPassCollisions"/>

Configures how collision events are passed to scripts in the linkset.

If Pass == TRUE, collisions involving collision-handling scripted child prims are also passed on to the root prim. If Pass == FALSE (default behavior), such collisions will only trigger events in the affected child prim.

<LSLFunction name="llPassTouches"/>

Configures how touch events are passed to scripts in the linkset.

If Pass == TRUE, touches involving touch-handling scripted child prims are also passed on to the root prim. If Pass == FALSE (default behavior), such touches will only trigger events in the affected child prim.

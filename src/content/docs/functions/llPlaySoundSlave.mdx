<LSLFunction name="llPlaySoundSlave"/>

Plays attached Sound once, at Volume (0.0 - 1.0), synced to next loop of most audible sync master.

Behaviour is identical to llPlaySound, unless there is a &quot;Sync Master&quot; present. If a Sync Master is already playing, the Slave sound will not be played until the Master hits its loop point and returns to the beginning.

llPlaySoundSlave will play the sound exactly once; if it is desired to have the sound play every time the Master loops, either use llLoopSoundSlave with extra silence padded on the end of the sound or ensure that llPlaySoundSlave is called at least once per loop of the Master.

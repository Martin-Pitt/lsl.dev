                   Ask the agent for permission to participate in an experience. This request is similar to llRequestPermissions with the following permissions: PERMISSION_TAKE_CONTROLS, PERMISSION_TRIGGER_ANIMATION, PERMISSION_ATTACH, PERMISSION_TRACK_CAMERA, PERMISSION_CONTROL_CAMERA and PERMISSION_TELEPORT. However, unlike llRequestPermissions the decision to allow or block the request is persistent and applies to all scripts using the experience grid wide. Subsequent calls to llRequestExperiencePermissions from scripts in the experience will receive the same response automatically with no user interaction. One of experience_permissions or experience_permissions_denied will be generated in response to this call. Outstanding permission requests will be lost if the script is derezzed, moved to another region or reset.

<LSLFunction name="llRequestPermissions"/>

Ask AvatarID to allow the script to perform certain actions, specified in the PermissionMask bitmask. PermissionMask should be one or more PERMISSION_* constants. Multiple permissions can be requested simultaneously by ORing the constants together. Many of the permissions requests can only go to object owner.

This call will not stop script execution. If the avatar grants the requested permissions, the run_time_permissions event will be called.

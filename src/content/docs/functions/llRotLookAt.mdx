Cause object to rotate to Rotation, with a force function defined by Strength and Damping parameters. Good strength values are around half the mass of the object and good damping values are less than 1/10th of the strength.

Asymmetrical shapes require smaller damping.

A strength of 0.0 cancels the look at.

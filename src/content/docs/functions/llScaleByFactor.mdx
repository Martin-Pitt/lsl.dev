	<Fragment slot="description">
		Attempts to resize the entire object by ScalingFactor, maintaining the size-position ratios of the prims.
		
		
		
		Resizing is subject to prim scale limits and linkability limits. This function can not resize the object if the linkset is physical, a pathfinding character, in a keyframed motion, or if resizing would cause the parcel to overflow.
		
		Returns a boolean (an integer) TRUE if it succeeds, FALSE if it fails.

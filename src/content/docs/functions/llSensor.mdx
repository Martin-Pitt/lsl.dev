import LSLFunction from '/src/content/templates/LSLFunction.astro'

<LSLFunction name="llSensor"/>

Performs a single scan for Name and ID with Type (AGENT, ACTIVE, PASSIVE, and/or SCRIPTED) within Range meters and Arc radians of forward vector.

Specifying a blank Name, 0 Type, or NULL_KEY ID will prevent filtering results based on that parameter. A range of 0.0 does not perform a scan.

Results are returned in the sensor and no_sensor events.

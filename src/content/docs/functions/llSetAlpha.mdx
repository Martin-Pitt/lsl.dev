<LSLFunction name="llSetAlpha"/>

Sets the alpha (opacity) of Face.

Sets the alpha (opacity) value for Face. If Face is ALL_SIDES, sets the alpha for all faces. The alpha value is interpreted as an opacity percentage (1.0 is fully opaque, and 0.2 is mostly transparent). This function will clamp alpha values less than 0.1 to 0.1 and greater than 1.0 to 1.

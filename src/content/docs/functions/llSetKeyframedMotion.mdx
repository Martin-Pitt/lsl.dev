<LSLFunction name="llSetKeyframedMotion"/>

Requests that a non-physical object be key-framed according to key-frame list.

Specify a list of times, positions, and orientations to be followed by an object. The object will be smoothly moved between key-frames by the simulator. Collisions with other non-physical or key-framed objects will be ignored (no script events will fire and collision processing will not occur). Collisions with physical objects will be computed and reported, but the key-framed object will be unaffected by those collisions.

Keyframes is a strided list containing positional, rotational, and time data for each step in the motion.  Options is a list containing optional arguments and parameters (specified by KFM_* constants).

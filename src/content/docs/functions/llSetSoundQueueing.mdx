<LSLFunction name="llSetSoundQueueing"/>

Sets whether successive calls to llPlaySound, llLoopSound, etc., (attached sounds) interrupt the currently playing sound.

The default for objects is FALSE. Setting this value to TRUE will make the sound wait until the current playing sound reaches its end. The queue is one level deep.

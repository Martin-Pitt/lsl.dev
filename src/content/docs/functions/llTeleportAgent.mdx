<LSLFunction name="llTeleportAgent"/>

Requests a teleport of avatar to a landmark stored in the object's inventory. If no landmark is provided (an empty string), the avatar is teleported to the location position in the current region. In either case, the avatar is turned to face the position given by look_at in local coordinates.

Requires the PERMISSION_TELEPORT permission. This function can only teleport the owner of the object.

Plays Sound at Volume (0.0 - 1.0), centered at but not attached to object.

There is no limit to the number of triggered sounds which can be generated by an object, and calling llTriggerSound does not affect the attached sounds created by llPlaySound and llLoopSound. This is very useful for things like collision noises, explosions, etc. There is no way to stop or alter the volume of a sound triggered by this function.

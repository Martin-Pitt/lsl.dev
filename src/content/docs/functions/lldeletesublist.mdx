		Removes the slice from start to end and returns the remainder of the list.
		
		Remove a slice from the list and return the remainder, start and end are inclusive.
		
		Using negative numbers for start and/or end causes the index to count backwards from the length of the list, so 0, -1 would delete the entire list.
		
		If Start is larger than End the list deleted is the exclusion of the entries; so 6, 4 would delete the entire list except for the 5th. list entry.

		                   Starts an asychronous transaction to retrieve the value associated with the key given. Will fail with XP_ERROR_KEY_NOT_FOUND if the key does not exist. The dataserver callback will be executed with the key returned from this call and a string describing the result. The result is a two element commma-delimited list. The first item is an integer specifying if the transaction succeeded (1) or not (0). In the failure case, the second item will be an integer corresponding to one of the XP_ERROR_... constants. In the success case the second item will be the value associated with the key.

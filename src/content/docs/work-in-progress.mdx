Hi, I'm Nexii Malthus, a resident of Second Life.

The plan for this website is to not simply be a mirror of the LSL Wiki but a new home for LSL.

<details>
<summary>The LSL Portal of the SL Wiki has its fair share of problems…</summary>

* Editing rights are locked down which goes against the operating principles of a wiki (soft-security)
* Downtime and no system admin highlights an unreliable platform that requires maintenance/upkeep
* The documentation is in dire need of a large scale rewrite
* There are conflicts with the redirects to the Knowledge Base for what are also LSL or technical terms causing frustration of being kidnapped to an external website
* There is no way for SLua to exist alongside LSL on the wiki; We need to build a future for SLua scripters
* Mediawiki page UI is not contextually relevant
* Search results can be really bad and slow

</details>


Still, I really do love the LSL Wiki and what we all managed to do through countless contributions.
It is where I started my path learning programming 20 years ago.
At that time the wiki was an unofficial website using a wacky little PHP framework called WakkaWiki on the domain lslwiki.net

So I want to resolve the issues we have with it today, take it back to its roots as a community website and modernise it.

* Everyone should be able to contribute
	* Running more like an Open Source project
	* I want clear guides on how you can contribute
	* Elevating regulars / editors / maintainers into position where they can approve PRs and edit directly
* LSL documentation needs a new Champion
	* In the past we had *Strife Onizuka* who became a pillar of the SL community with his work on the wiki
	* LSL.dev is my passion project, so I'll be taking on that role of a champion
* Best practices of modern documentation sites
* Refine the information architecture of the LSL wiki
* Become a beacon for modernising SL documentation


## Roadmap

1. Development plan:
	* [x] Setup github project and sister project (slua.dev)
	* [x] Read up docs / change settings / figure out approach
	* [x] Establish core content templates (LSL Functions, Events, Constants, …?)
	* [x] Generate pages for all LSL functions, events & constants
	* [ ] Template component for documenting function/event arguments
	* [ ] Migrate from LSL Wiki (CC-BY-SA)
	* [ ] Landing Pages
	* [ ] Feature Pagess
		* The "LSL Feature" pages like Attachments, Communications, Combat2, Experience, Linkset Data, etc!
	* [ ] Constant Collections (Pages & reusable Component for use in docs pages)
	* Footers, legals, project legals, licensing?
		* I might need some help on this
2. LSL Dev Docs are in a usable state
	* This is the point at which I can proudly share LSL.dev with the community
	* Putting a link to LSL.dev from the LSL Portal
3. Further development
	* Have some funding/sponsorships, so I can dedicate more time to the project. Especially expand outside of LSL for modernised content creation portal and/or modernised general SL knowledge
	* Potentially use funding towards hiring/commissioning technical writers from existing LSL Scripters
	* [ ] How to contribute
		* Making an edit to an existing page
		* Creating a new page
		* etc.
	* Start work on sister project at slua.dev
	* Moving repo into a github organisation dedicated to documentation of Second Life
